# NatMicCorder
NatMicCorder is a minimal project illustrating NatMic and NatCorder API integration in Unity Engine. We record the user from the front camera when they press and hold the record button.
- [NatCam API](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/natcam-webcam-api-52154) is used for the camera preview
- [NatCorder API](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/natcorder-video-recording-api-102645) is used for video recording
- [NatMic API](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/123358) is used for recording the microphone
- [NatShare API](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/natshare-mobile-sharing-api-117705) is used for social sharing
