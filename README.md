# NatMicCorder
NatMicCorder is a minimal project illustrating NatMic and NatCorder API integration in Unity Engine. We record the user from the front camera when they press and hold the record button. We use NatCam API for the camera preview; NatCorder for video recording; and NatMic for recording the microphone.

## Requirements
- Unity 2017+
